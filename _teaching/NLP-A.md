This course delves into advanced concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) with a strong focus on modern deep learning techniques. It covers foundational topics such as tokenization, text representation, and pipelines, as well as cutting-edge research in large language models (LLMs), transformers, and their applications. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, preparing students to tackle real-world NLP challenges, including security, privacy, and human-centered design. During the semester, students will also have the opportunity to test and train these architectures on real data using cloud-based services [(Google Collab)](https://colab.google/).
