Within the framework of the subject, students will learn about the basics of natural language text processing (NLP). In addition, they also gain practical experience while solving various tasks. Main topics: logistic regression, naive Bayes model, PCA, n-gram models, Word2Vec, classical and recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, during the completion of the subject, students can gain insight into current, modern neural architectures. During the semester, students will also have the opportunity to test and train these architectures on real data using cloud-based services [(Google Collab)](https://colab.google/).

## Requirements

- Attendance sheet: Fewer absences than allowed. Active participation in classes.
- Creating a working application and presenting it in the form of a video using the solutions and models learned in class.
     - It must be uploaded to Github and shared.
     - Maximum length of video is 5-10 minutes.
     - In the video, each creator must present their own contribution. (for 3-8 minutes)
     - At the end of the video, the application must be shown in action. (for 1-2 minutes)
- Organizing into teams (2-4 people) or working individually.
- If the creator(s) uses a service based on a generative language model to complete the task, then must attach the prompt log to the completed project as additional material.
- It is not sure that the team members receive a uniform grades, but get the grades in proportion to the task they have completed in the project.
- Method of submission: [By email](mailto:lakatos.robert@inf.unideb.hu)
- Submission deadline: 2024.12.20.
