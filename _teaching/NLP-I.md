Within the framework of the subject, students will learn about the basics of natural language text processing (NLP). In addition, they also gain practical experience while solving various tasks. Main topics: logistic regression, naive Bayes model, PCA, n-gram models, Word2Vec, classical and recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, during the completion of the subject, students can gain insight into current, modern neural architectures. During the semester, students will also have the opportunity to test and train these architectures on real data using cloud-based services [(Google Collab)](https://colab.google/).
