Within the framework of the subject, students will learn about the basics of natural language text processing (NLP). In addition, they also gain practical experience while solving various tasks. Main topics: logistic regression, naive Bayes model, PCA, n-gram models, Word2Vec, classical and recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, during the completion of the subject, students can gain insight into current, modern neural architectures. During the semester, students will also have the opportunity to test and train these architectures on real data using cloud-based services [(Google Collab)](https://colab.google/).

## Requirements

- Fewer absences than allowed. Active participation in classes.
- Organizing into teams (2-4 people) or working individually.
- Creating a working application and presenting it in the form of a video using the solutions and models learned in class.
     - It must be uploaded to Github and shared.
     - Maximum length of video is 5-10 minutes.
     - In the video, each creator must present their own contribution. (for 3-8 minutes)
     - At the end of the video, the application must be shown in action. (for 1-2 minutes)
- The team members do not receive a uniform ticket, but get the ticket in proportion to the task they have completed in the project.
- Method of submission: [By email](mailto:lakatos.robert@inf.unideb.hu)
- Submission deadline: ****
