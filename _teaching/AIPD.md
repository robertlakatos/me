The subject aims for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence (AI) and their application in business planning and decision-making. During the classes, students gain insight into various AI technologies, such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and optimization algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on real industry examples and case studies, with the help of which students understand how these tools can be applied to solve various business challenges.

The course also covers the ethical issues of AI, such as transparency, avoiding bias, and regulatory and legal frameworks for decision-making. At the end of the course, students can try out the learned techniques in practice in a project and develop an AI-based solution to a real business problem.
