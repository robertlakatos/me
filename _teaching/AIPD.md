The subject aims for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence (AI) and their application in business planning and decision-making. During the classes, students gain insight into various AI technologies, such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and optimization algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on real industry examples and case studies, with the help of which students understand how these tools can be applied to solve various business challenges.

The course also covers the ethical issues of AI, such as transparency, avoiding bias, and regulatory and legal frameworks for decision-making. At the end of the course, students can try out the learned techniques in practice in a project and develop an AI-based solution to a real business problem.

## Requirements

- Attendance sheet: Fewer absences than allowed. Active participation in classes.
- Creating a project that you have to use AI solutions and you have to make/propose a decision based on your project results.  
     - You have to present it live and personally last lesson (2025. 12. 11. 16:00:00 - 2025. 12. 11. 18:00:00).
     - If the creator(s) uses a service based on a generative language model to complete the task, then must attach the prompt log to the completed project as additional material.
     - It must be uploaded to Github and shared.
     - You must submit your project using the submission form by the deadline (2025.12.10 24:00)
- Organizing into teams (2-4 people) or working individually.
- It is not sure that the team members receive a uniform grades, but get the grades in proportion to the task they have completed in the project.

- **Submission deadline: 2025.12.14. 24:00 (Sunday)**
- [**Submission form**]()
     - Mandatory fields: Neptun code, Video link, Source link.
     - If there are more than one of you, the Neptun code can be entered as a list separated by commas.
     - The Source link contains the source code.
     - The Video link contains the video code.
     - If two are the same, the same must be entered in both places.
     - If there are no exceptional obstacles, please allow (chose **'yes'** on the form) your submitted work to be shared among the students of the following semesters within the framework of the subject.
