The subject aims for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence (AI) and their application in business planning and decision-making. During the classes, students gain insight into various AI technologies, such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and optimization algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on real industry examples and case studies, with the help of which students understand how these tools can be applied to solve various business challenges.

The course also covers the ethical issues of AI, such as transparency, avoiding bias, and regulatory and legal frameworks for decision-making. At the end of the course, students can try out the learned techniques in practice in a project and develop an AI-based solution to a real business problem.

## Requirements

- Attendance sheet: Fewer absences than allowed. Active participation in classes.
- Creating a working application and presenting it in the form of a video using the solutions and models learned in class.
     - It must be uploaded to Github and shared.
     - Maximum length of video is 5-10 minutes.
     - In the video, each creator must present their own contribution.
- Organizing into teams (2-4 people) or working individually.
- If the creator(s) uses a service based on a generative language model to complete the task, then must attach the prompt log to the completed project as additional material.
- It is not sure that the team members receive a uniform grades, but get the grades in proportion to the task they have completed in the project.
- Method of submission: [By email](mailto:lakatos.robert@inf.unideb.hu)
- Submission deadline: ****
