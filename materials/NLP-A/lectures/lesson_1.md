## Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is a field of science and engineering focused on the development and study of automatic systems that understand and generate natural (that is, human,) languages.

### Historical moments

- June 2018: the GPT, the first pre-trained Transformer model used to fine-tune various NLP tasks, achieves state-of-the-art results
- October 2018: BERT, another large pre-trained model designed to summarise sentences better (more on this in the next chapter!)
- February 2019: GPT-2, an improved (and larger) version of GPT, which was not immediately released publicly due to ethical concerns
- October 2019: DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT's performance
- October 2019: BART and T5, two large, pre-baked models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)
- May 2020, GPT-3, an even bigger version of GPT-2 that performs well on many tasks without fine-tuning (so-called zero-shot learning).
- March 2022, GPT-3.5, an even larger version of GPt-2 and larger than GPT-3, and the network base for the first chatGPT.
- April 2022, PaLM (Pathways Language Model) a 540 billion-parameter dense decoder-only transformer-based large language model (LLM) developed by Google AI.
- February 2023, Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) open source generative large language model family.
- March 2023, GPT-4.
- December 2023, Gemini (The new PaLM).
- January 2025, DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek Chatbot) DeepSeek's success against larger and larger rivals has been described as "disrupting AI" and "the first shot in the global AI race that is now emerging".
