##  Structured data

- **Tabular data:** Data stored in databases, tables, with well-defined rows and columns, such as relational databases (SQL).
- **Time series data:** Measurement results stored in a structured form, where the values ​​assigned to different times are present (e.g. stock prices, changes in sensor data over time).
- **Network data (Graph data):** Networks of connections, such as social media networks or route networks. - - Although in some cases it can be considered semi-structured, they often have a well-defined structure.

## Semi-structured data

- **Document-based data:** data in XML, JSON format, which are structured at a certain level, but not in a rigid tabular format.
- **Spatial (geospatial) data:** GPS coordinates, map data. These are usually stored in a semi-structured format (e.g. GeoJSON, KML).
- **Sensor data:** Although structured to some extent, it is often present in semi-structured form, especially when different types of sensors send different data or when different formats (e.g. CSV or JSON) are used.

## Unstructured data

- **Text data:** Content of articles, e-mails, chat messages, web pages. These are often completely unstructured and do not have a well-defined format.
- **Audio data:** Voice recordings, music, sound effects, which usually do not contain a structure (e.g. MP3, WAV).
- **Video data:** Movies, moving image content (e.g. MP4, AVI), where the structure is minimal.
- **Image data:** Photos, images (e.g. JPG, PNG), which are usually stored in an unstructured form.
- **Holographic and 3D data:** 3D models, CAD files that usually do not have a standard structure (eg STL, OBJ).
- **Binary data:** Data that is stored in raw binary form and has no explicit structure (e.g. image files, program code).
